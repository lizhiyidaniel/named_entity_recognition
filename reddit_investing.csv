Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio stepped down as co-investment chief of the largest U.S. hedge fund firm, nearly five decades after he started it in his Manhattan apartment.

The move, finalized Friday following a tumultuous yearslong succession process, leaves a handful of Dalio associates in charge of the firm, which has $150 billion under management. Mr. Dalio remains on the Bridgewater board.

The apparent winners in the Bridgewater succession drama are co-investment chiefs and Bridgewater veterans Bob Prince and Greg Jensen, who had a public falling out with Mr. Dalio, and co-chief executives Nir Bar Dea and Mark Bertolini, newer entrants on the scene who were named to their posts in January. But some cast Mr. Dalio as a winner, too, effecting a transition on his terms and timeline.

Looking to go long 1-2 year yields as directly as possible.|"This has been such a struggle for me over the past year. I want to trade short term interest rates but the only ETFs available with any liquidity are much longer term (10-30 year) like TBT. I have made due in after tax accounts by going short the 2-year treasury note futures (ZT) but I cant trade futures on certain accounts and the leverage on those contracts is large enough to be unwieldy regardless. 

I have resorted to trading TBT shares and options (the most liquid treasury etf I can find) on the accounts that cant trade futures but since it attempts to track the 20 year yield, it puts me very much at a handicap since even if the Fed keeps hiking as I believe they will, the longer term maturities can at least lag if not inverse the short terms when people don't believe (justifiably) the policy can continue long term. 

Long story short I want to trade short term rate expectations as directly as possible, ideally through a stock or ETF (ideally optionable) while avoiding futures when possible. Anyone have a recommendation? 

...that being said if anyone has recommendations on other futures/futures options to look besides ZT for the accounts I CAN trade futures on, I am all ears as well"|0.67|1.0|0.0|1.0
t3_xvlkrk|1664905529.0|investing|Market under-reacting to rate hikes is making the equities overvalued|"At least according to the excess cape yield. [The mean since ~~1981~~ 1881 is 4.67%](https://www.gurufocus.com/economic_indicators/4530/shiller-excess-cape-yield-for-the-sp-500). In July, the latest the website shows, the excess yield cape was 3.13% - a slightly lower than average yield. Keep in mind since we take the inverse of ShIller CAPE the lower number is better. Right now the CAPE ratio is at [28.21](https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe). 1/28.21 gives us a 3.5% and the 10 yield treasury yield stands at [3.621%](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/bond/tmubmusd10y?countrycode=bx). This gives us a -0.121% yield. One of the lowest ever. To revert to the mean the Shiller CAPE ratio has to come down to around 12, a 58% from the current levels. 

Calculation as follows 4.67% (mean) + 3.621 (10 year yield) = 8.291. 1/8.291 = 12 (CAPE).

This doesn’t factor in future rate hikes either.

FYI, I’m not predicting a 58% drop, I think the market is pricing a future rate ~~hike~~ cut which will make the current levels revert closer to the mean. However the risk here is that inflation is more persistent than expected and rate hikes persist. That will make people switch from equity markets to risk-free bonds and then we can expect a massive reaction in the equity markets

Investors have continued to aggressively increase their short positions in the global equity markets, Citi strategists led by Chris Montagu said in a note.

The stock market is currently being “dominated” by new short flows. Montagu notes that bearish positioning extended further last week with as much as $22 billion in new short positions added. Just the S&amp;P 500 saw $13.4 billion in new shorts added.

“Short profit levels have become the focus, with profits near 10% and, given the much larger notional exposures, risks have tilted towards short profit-taking, which may alleviate some of the recent declines,” Montagu told clients in a note.

In Europe, [Euro Stoxx 50](https://www.investing.com/indices/eu-stoxx50) is the most extended short futures market, according to Citi.

“[DAX Futures](https://www.investing.com/indices/germany-30-futures) (-2.4) have been trending in line with EuroStoxx, with [FTSE](https://www.investing.com/indices/uk-100) futures net notional positioning also in decline, however positioning is still net positive (+1.4) overall despite the significant rise in market volatility last week.”

Montagu also discussed a “difficult” September for global stocks with the S&amp;P 500 recording the worst monthly performance of 2022 after falling over 9%.

The [S&amp;P 500](https://www.investing.com/indices/us-spx-500) staged a relief rally yesterday, rising 2.59% to 3,678.43. [S&amp;P 500 Futures](https://www.investing.com/indices/us-spx-500-futures) are also trading around 1.8% higher in Tuesday's pre-open trading."|0.88|423.0|0.0|423.0

See  [Short Sell Against the Box Definition (investopedia.com](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sellagainstthebox.asp)  if needed. So in the USA it's not allowed, but in Canada I did not find any information covering this.

""Playing both sides"" is another way to put it, I got fed up of seeing my portfolio get trashed too often (2020, 2022, ...) and want to do something more than just ""waiting it out"" in my bunker ;-)

I got into that by accident because I really got into trading options selling and hedging on stocks I own (long) or sometimes not (on margin). I got a couple accounts, so I can easily be long in one account and short in the other, actually one account is mostly for my long stocks which are mostly dividend payers or stocks I want to hold long term. In another I trade shorter term stuff and more speculative things (swing stocks / options, try to limit risk / profit from downside). So sometimes I got assigned short (got called on options for shares I didn't have). At first was closing it right away, but then eventually though ""I'm also long so it doesn't matter much"", so I was much more patient than would normally be (thinking in the worse case I'll just have less profits). but actually was quite successful in a few cases at profiting from some huge down swings. Brookfield (BAM) is my main go-to stock for this (and one of my biggest positions).

At first I was typically using ETFs to short as they are quite liquid and relatively easy to find some matching roughly any given stock's moves (high correlation). But then thought why not short the stocks I own, there's no better hedge!!  I thought I was brilliant, but then I realized hmm what's the taxes going to say about that ?  It sounds a little fishy, in the USA it's not allowed, but at the same time I don't see why it wouldn't be allowed when there's so many possibilities using options.

Anyone knows the answer ?  And if not allowed, what's the alternatives ?   Could I instead simply sell  ""deep in the money"" calls so they act like a short (for example calls at a strike 40$ on a stock that trades at 50$) ?  I preferred the short stock approach as there's no time limit (other than margin interests &amp; fees) as options add another time (expiry) risk.

Another idea I had, but it only works for some stocks which dual listings, is long one  in TSX and short the US one (assuming it's probably easier + more liquid to short the US one, plus it's simpler for my taxes as I'm in Canada to be long the CA one). But again, is this allowed ?  I'd think it must be in the rule, if there's one. Something like: ""you cannot sell short securities you are long (or very similar securities) without facing tax consequences"".

The reason? It’s cheaper than investing in most mutual funds, there’s far less trading (which increases costs), and the primary structure that is used to invest in index funds — Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), also have tax advantages.


No one can pinpoint the exact date when it became clear that investing in index funds had won out over investing in active management, but Warren Buffett declaring it to be so was certainly a pivotal moment.

The year was 2007. Buffett had entered into a bet with Protege Partners, a New York City money management firm that runs funds of hedge funds, that an index fund could beat an active manager.

My co-founder and I are working on building a company to track the effect of climate risk on an organization's balance sheets. I would love to hear your input/thoughts.

We believe share prices do not adequately reflect the impact of climate change on physical infrastructure, and many public organizations are not adequately prepared for the impact of climate change, leading to unpriced risk.

A few examples:

* PG&amp;E: Filed for bankruptcy partly after experiencing $30 billion caused by fires in 2017 and 2018. This bankruptcy filing, among other issues, has led to their stocks dropping over 80% in the past 5 years. I believe we could have priced in some of the climate risks they face through remotely monitoring infrastructure and tracking broader weather patterns in California.

* TransAlta: They are a Canadian utility on the leading edge of disclosing operational risk from climate change. Even though they are good at disclosure, the following study shows that factoring in extreme weather risk into their stock price reduces the value estimate by \~31%. I imagine the effect of climate may be worse in companies with opaque communication on climate impacts on their business.

Hello,

I work at an investment bank as an internal FX execution specialist and have dabbled into the equity market last year. At this point, I have aggressively saved into the equity market into declining conditions. My largest position SPY is down from a 400 basis, and I seek to put more into this market. Problem is, my liquidity is pretty much all tied up, from cash I need to pay rent/bills, emergency fund, and ESOs. have excess income of about $500 a month and I am thinking of doubling my portfolio using margin on MSFT to the tune of two round lots(200s). This way I can sell CCs if they immediately decline.

However, I would not say my risk tolerance is particularly extremely high, but the alternative would be throwing 500 a month at the market, and over a period of time, my DCA *could* be much higher than buying in bulk at one place in time.

Margin is usually touted as a trading device, but what about an investment one with a time horizon of more than 8 months.

DCA or buy now, paying $500 of margin per month in your opinion?"|0.33|0.0|0.0|0.0

My goalwas to see

1. end resulting performance of the investments over time
2. longest period of net negative returns for the positionDCA = investing a fixed amount of money on a fixed time interval regardless of price or marketconditionsMethod: allocate a fixed amount of cash to position every month. Whenever the cash on hand is enough to buy at least one share of the asset, purchase the asset at the Adj. Close price listed from Yahoo Finance historical data.

I chose investing period start times of 2000-04-01, representing someone starting investing at the peak of the dot com bubble, 2006-01-01, representing someone beginning their investments leading up to the financial crisis, 2007-10-01, representing someone starting investing at the top of the market in 2007, and 2009-03-01, representing someone nearly perfectly timing the bottom of the financial crisis.

Results:

|DCA start period|Longest negative ROI|current day ROI(%)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|2000-04-01|2000-09-01 to 2003-11-01|219|

|2007-10-01|2008-06-01 to 2009-09-01|150.23|

Takeaways and other info:

\- if you can stomach a 1-3  year period of negative returns, you should not be shaken even if you started investing at the peak of the latest market cycle.

\- The reason for the period of negative ROI for the investor who started at the peak of the market is because of the nature of DCA, where earlier investments have a more significant impact on the overall average compared to later additions. Investors who felt the most pain were the ones who had invested substantial amounts of money during the bull runs leading up to the crashes.

\- if you started investing near the peak of the market, DCA is a powerful tool to quickly get back to a positive ROI for the market. The stock market peaked in 10/2007 and didn't reach that price again until 04/2013. If you had DCA'd your way through the crash if you started investing at the top, you would be sitting at a ROI of 43%, with an equivalent cost basis of the market price from mid 2003.

\- if you're fearing the market may not reach it's 2021 highs for years, it's still in your best interest to keep averaging in to the market in the meantime."|0.91|275.0|0.0|275.0

The bonds were expiring soon and part of the restructuring included that Posadas would issue new bonds in exchange for the old ones.

&gt;&gt;*“NOTICE OF ENTRY OF ORDER APPROVING DISCLOSURE STATEMENT FOR AND CONFIRMING DEBTORS' JOINT PREPACKAGED

was very legal sounding and, since my parents English is limited, they asked their financial advisor about it and whether they needed to write back. The advisor told them it was a mere formality and that they didn’t need to do anything. 

Long story short, they DID need to write back, and they lost any right to any claim to their bonds. The advisor is shrugging it off, telling them there’s nothing he can do and referring them to Posadas (who of course doesn’t want anything to do with my parents).

On the other hand, some mutual funds take a few days to get your money out while ETFs are basically instant.

What to buy: EUO (ProShares UltraShort Euro). 

What to do/When to do it: Buy up now because this will make you money in the mid term (3-9 months). 

What to buy: PSQ (ProShares Short QQQ ETF). Note that this is not leveraged like SQQQ so you can track it more closely. 

What to do/When to do it: Buy up now, the US economy is not going to turn around until 2024 people."|0.33|0.0|0.0|0.0

t3_xu2g89|1664751321.0|investing|Explanation needed: Why are short term US treasury ETFs not reflecting the rise in interest rates?|"Hi there,

I was looking at short (1-3months) US treasuries, to take advantage of the rising interest rates for the next couple months until I return to total market ETFs. I have been looking at the following ETF: SPDR® Bloomberg 1-3 Month T-Bill UCITS ETF (Acc) ([link to justetf page here](https://www.justetf.com/en/etf-profile.html?assetClass=class-bonds&amp;groupField=index&amp;country=US&amp;bm=0-3&amp;from=search&amp;isin=IE00BJXRT698#overview)). 

However, the funds past performance both in the Key Investor Information Document (KIID), and the graph shown on justetf reflect much more modest gains, nothing close to the current treasury yield.


(note: the currency must be switched to USD, otherwise you will be looking at a pretty flat line overlapping the USD/EUR exchange rate, which is why the ETF appears to have gone up significantly in 2022 in euros).

Where is the catch? According to [the official treasury website](https://home.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/TextView?type=daily_treasury_yield_curve&amp;field_tdr_date_value_month=202209), the current yield for 3-Month treasuries is 3.2%, significantly more than the cumulative 0.2% rise in the ETFs share price in all of 2022.

My interest would be using it as a money market alternative, which I can't find on DEGIRO. US treasuries at 3.2% with such short duration is as ""low"" risk money as there can be right now while maintaining flexibility and immunity from continually rising interest rates crashing longer term bond ETFs.

Can anyone point me to the right direction? Why hasn't the ETFs price risen more during the last couple months?"|0.83|45.0|0.0|45.0

t3_xtyml0|1664741738.0|investing|Anyone use signals or indicators to go from risk-on to risk-off?|"I was considering setting up some kind of simple system in which a signal (or combination of signals) would cause me to re-allocate my portfolio from, say, 100% equities (risk on) to 50% equities/50% short term treasuries (risk off) and vice versa, on a long-term basis. Obviously with the intent of avoiding sharp and/or prolonged drawdowns and losses.

The most common signal I am finding is to go risk off when a death cross occurs, and go back risk on when a subsequent golden cross occurs. This seems pretty simple, straightforward and robotic (which is what I'm looking for) and would have resulted in a significantly lower drawdown and fewer losses during the 2000 dot-com crash and the 2007-2009 GFC. However, I noticed this indicator lags a bit and you may already be experiencing a pretty significant drawdown by the time you would be signaled to go risk off (e.g., COVID crash in March 2020). I was also a bit concerned with using only one indicator to signal risk on/risk off.

Since I am still in the accumulation phase, I would continue to make regular contributions to my portfolio every month, only I would allocate those contributions accordingly based on what scenario my portfolio was in at the time (i.e., 100% of contribution to equities during risk on, 50/50 during risk off).

Just curious if anyone else employs a similar strategy for their portfolio and, if so, some ideas on indicators to use in combination with each other to trigger a risk on/risk off signal. Daily MAs? MACD? RSI? Some other type of indicator like credit spreads?"|0.55|1.0|0.0|1.0

t3_xt88kw|1664663717.0|investing|My father is exhausted, so I need to take a huge decision for my life.|" 

*Let me thank you in advance for reading my post. Your opinion or advice can change my life at this moment.*

&amp;#x200B;

I’m from Bolivia in South America, I’m 20 years old currently at University in the major of Physics. No income and the university is just 4$ dollars per semester. 

Just recently my father retired from the police and he’s really exhausted because of the 30 years of unstoppable working routing. We had a conversation days ago and he asked me if I wanted to do something with the money he saved through these years. He said there’s about 60,000$ in the bank that I can use to do something. We have **no debts nor a mortgage**.

I have to be clear, I have never focused on things related to the financial world because I was always reading about science. However, after this talk we had I started my research about things that are possible to do for someone in my place. Of course there was always the idea of starting a new business, but the problem is that in my country to do that it is really hard because of the amount of restrictions, high taxes; for any kind of business, huge time gap to get the papers needed or the money under the table you need to pay for papers and controls, that exist one time the business had open. There are more small reasons, the point is that business is out.

As my father's only condition is having at least 3% of net income per month in order to give me that money. I thought about making money on the internet, that's how I came here and learned more about bonds, stock, etc.. Sadly, most of the specific information is focused on other countries and doesn’t help me to be clear. Still I can have an idea of the options I have with this money. I’ve already done the analysis using the ‘personal income spending flowchart’, provided in personal finance, for all the members of my family. As a conclusion, **2,5% net income** of the 60K dollars is enough to us per month even using the 50/30/20 rule.

I need to add that my father has a house that is about 320k dollars and can be quickly sold for 250k; and he said that **if I reach 5% net income** average in anything I do, he will sell it and give me the money to keep doing whatever I choose. 

In brief, what I would like to know is:

First of all, is it even realistic for me that I’m just starting to learn about this world to aim for a goal of 5% net income?

If you think it is not, then maybe this ‘opportunity’ is not for me. But, if I don’t give up with this idea, is it possible to reach that net income of 3% on the internet in my country? If you don’t know or you think it is not a good idea to try that while being here, what about in the USA? I have an aunt there and she has a nice business in NY, so I do have the option of getting the work visa to go there with the money even if taxes were involved. In this case I would quit university and, if possible, I will continue after establishing a secure income (5% per month).

My spread is quite reasonable (I don't go all out with a high-risk spread). In fact, it's close to the same spread I had with LendingClub when they still offered the service and I was always doing fantastic. So my guess is either the pandemic mixed with inflation is leading to a huge uptick in bankruptcies and unpaid accounts or something fishy is happening at Prosper. Since the latter option wouldn't be so wise of the company, I can only assume that this many people are having trouble paying their loans suddenly (I am getting multiple emails every week).

I get it. Like with every high-probability trade, it works until it doesn't. And I also get there's no such thing as a free lunch, so I'm probably missing something. But when buying options, our max loss is defined, it's just the premium we pay. So even if the whole financial system collapses, as long as you only invest what you can afford to lose, you should be fine. Here is my potential set-up:

&amp;#x200B;

VIX is trading above 30 right now, which is perceived quite high. Let's say I buy a 30 put(cost of 940), longest expiration possible, which is 2023/06/21, or about 33 weeks from now. Break even for this trade is 25.60 at expiration. Of course if it reaches this price level before experiation, you'll make a profit since there's still time value left in the contract. But let's take this level as a worst case scenario.

&amp;#x200B;

Looking at the charts, when VIX spikes above 30, it's usually for a very small amount of time, just a couple of weeks. However, sometimes it can take a while to come back down to profitable levels. For example in 1998, it was above 30 for 12 weeks and got back to 25.60 after 15 weeks. In 2002, once it got above 30, it only went down to 25.60 after 19 weeks. And those are the 2 worst cases I could find, and these are still well within the scope of our 33 weeks we have in our options contract. With 1 exception...

&amp;#x200B;

In 2008-2009, the VIX was above 30 for 35 weeks straight, only getting back to our virtual break even of 25.60 after 43 weeks! If this would happen again, our option would generate a loss if held until expiration.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't have an exact exit strategy yet, because I want to see if you guys can pick some holes in my theory. But it would look something like this:

&amp;#x200B;

First 15 weeks or so, don't be greedy. VIX is high for a reason. Recession/depression like in 2008 is on the table, so take profits at a reasonable level, let's say if VIX gets back to 25. If that happens 1 month after you take the trade, you'll get 300 profit, which is like a 380% annualized return. After 15 weeks, get out of the trade at first sight of break even and don't get greedy. When the contract just doesn't want to get back to break even, look to roll the contract to a further expiration date when there's at least 2 months left in the contract, because that's when theta is going to ramp up. Sure, you might have to take a temporary loss by rolling the contract, but at these price levels, the eventual reward will make up for the debit you pay here, because VIX can't stay high forever, since the market can only fall for so long.

&amp;#x200B;

It's getting late out here, and I haven't backtested this strat for the entirety of VIX's existence (if there is enough interest I might add it later), but this strategy would have been highly profitable if you ran it from the covid-crash until now. I know, hindsight 20-20 right? If you bought a put every time VIX hits 30 and sell the put once price hits 25.60, which is our break even at expiration when buying the option as far out as possible, but will yield a massive profit if it hits that price only after a few days/weeks, it would have a track record of 20 out of 20 times!

t3_xsbmru|1664569640.0|investing|Is now the time to get into High Dividend Yield Index Funds?|"I'm a big fan of Vanguard, particularly of the holdings they manage and their comparatively low expense ratios. I'm in my mid-20s and strictly a mutual fund investor. Since 2020 I've been dumping a few hundred dollars every month into their VFTAX mutual fund exclusively. I'm sitting at about 250 shares worth just under 10K. With all of the market craziness going on today I've been thinking, would it be a good idea to go into a high dividend-yielding mutual fund offered by Vanguard? I'm thinking VHYAX or VDADX. Does anyone here operate in high dividend yielding type funds? I'm considering this because owning nearly 10K of one fund nets me about $35 every three months in dividend distributions. I was okay with that initially as my sole focus starting out was capital growth, but I'm just looking to generate a little bit more from my dividends now, maybe funneling higher distributions from VHYAX/VDADX into VFTAX to start generating some positive momentum (at least to the point where I'm buying at least a whole share each quarter). I will reinvest all dividends from my brokerage fund back into my holdings and my time horizon is 20-30 years.

tl;dr Is there a case to be made in this environment to start adding high-yielding dividend mutual funds into your portfolio? Pros? Cons?"|0.64|14.0|0.0|14.0

t3_xsa4d8|1664565945.0|investing|Stocks have a Bond Problem: Historical Performance|"I will attempt to explain the title without using graphs, because it seems the Mods do not really like such; same goes from links to sources. I will provide the name of sources and references below.

All investments are relative, thus how TINA (There Is No Alternative) came about. Over the past century, the performance of the S&amp;P 500 (Stocks) versus US Investment Grade Corporate Bond Total Return Index (Bonds), aka the Stock to Bond Ratio (Ratio), has relatively defined peaks and troughs.

Generally, when the S&amp;P 500 is greater than 1x (to Bonds), we see a long period (decade plus) of under-performance vs Bonds that can come in short order:

* June 1929: Ratio crosses above 1x
* August 1929: Ratio peaks at 1.11x
* September 1929: Ratio goes below 1x
* May 1932: Ratio is 0.19x
* January 1955: Ratio crosses 0.50x for the first since since falling below said level (April 1931)
* For this entire period: Bonds +157%, Stocks +36%

&amp;#x200B;

* October 1964: Ratio crosses above 1x (1.02x)
* October 1968: Ratio peaks at 1.31x
* November 1973: Ratio drops below 1x
* From 1978 - 1994: Ratio fluctuated between 0.64x and 1.02x (briefly over 1x), with a majority of the time the ratio resting below 0.75x
* For this entire period (through 1994): Bonds +704%, Stocks +444%

&amp;#x200B;

* May 1997: Ratio crosses above 1x
* May 2000: Ratio peaks at 1.46x
* August 2001: Ratio drops below 1x
* January 2009: Ratio bottoms at 0.51x
* For this entire period: Bonds +84%, Stocks -8%

&amp;#x200B;

* August 2018: Ratio crosses above 1x but never breaks higher like prior times
* May 2020: Ratio bottoms at 0.75x (COVID)
* August 2020: Ratio crosses above 1x
* April 2022: Ratio peaks at 1.43x
* For this period: Bonds +2%, Stocks +28% (I've group this time period together given peak levels)

Current level (September 2022): 1.25x

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

If we look at the median ratio level by decade, we find the following:

* 1920s: 0.51x
* 1930s: 0.32x
* 1940s: 0.24x
* 1950s: 0.50x
* 1960s: 0.98x
* 1970s: 0.86x
* 1980s: 0.77x
* 1990s: 0.75x
* 2000s: 0.79x
* 2010s: 0.92x
* 2020s: 1.21x

Given history, it seems unreasonable to expect this level of performance in stocks relative to bonds. This is not an absolute call on stocks (bull or bear), but only relative to corporate bonds given history. Yes, the S&amp;P and the Bond Index composition has changed over these decades, however it seems fair to use this data and a just one mean of trying to identify stock values relative to other alternatives, in this case investment grade corporate credit.

Edit: formatting

Edit 2: as correctly pointed out by u/tachyonvelocity this is using the S&amp;P 500 price index and not the total return, therefore some periods mentioned above do not reflect dividends and buybacks and therefore stocks outperformed bonds (1964-1994).

But while correct, if I completed this sort of analysis I would also use a volatility-weighted, risk adjusted approach. In relative trading for me, this is the single most critical aspect. For this subreddit and for buy and hold and DCAs, it likely has no relevance. 

Hugh Hendry once gave a presentation in 2016 where he showed a chart that showed the US equities lost value to US 10y treasuries from 1971 to 2016 by 75% after adjusted for volatility… of course, as he rightfully stated and you might imagine, you’re long 10y up to you ears, but again, it puts assets on a “constant basis”. 

Ray Dalio has also tried to explain this in that a 50/50 portfolio where stocks and bonds are negatively correlated, when volatility adjusted isn’t a true 50/50 portfolio, but more 80 (stocks) / 20 portfolio."|0.79|37.0|0.0|37.0
t3_xs9pxi|1664564988.0|investing|Stats from the last four bear markets compared to the current one|"There have been four bear markets\* in the last 35 years prior to the current one: 1987, 2000-2002, 2007-2008, and 2019-2020.  (\*A bear market being defined as a 20% or more decline in the S&amp;P 500 from its prior peak.)  

The peak-to-trough declines for these bear markets ranged from -20% to -51%.  The VIX at capitulation\*\* ranged from 40 to 153 (!).  The maximum one-day declines at capitulation ranged from -5.3% to -21.5%.  (\*\*Capitulation was the day of highest volatility that either marked the low for the bear market or was within a few days of the ultimate low.)

The S&amp;P is currently down \~25% from its prior peak.  The maximum VIX for this bear market was 34.8 back in May (so didn't represent the low.)  Over the last week the maximum VIX has been 33.8 and the worst one-day decline was 2.4%.    

Interestingly, in all four previous bear markets the S&amp;P declined to the long-term trend line or (well) below it.  The long-term trend line for the S&amp;P is currently between 2500 and 3000, depending on your starting point.

Now, four data points isn't even close to statistically significant - this information might be meaningless in the current context.  This time could be different.  But... I do wonder if market psychology approximately rhymes during these extreme downturns and if certain characteristics must be present in order to reflect capitulation and mark a true bottom.

They've lost about 17% of their value since I bought them. I started looking at selling them to harvest losses for next year's taxes, but am struggling with how to avoid running afoul of the wash sale rule by buying something that isn't substantially identical in the view of the IRS. 

I've done this with stocks which obviously is easier, but these two funds have rather diverse holdings. FBNDX is about 40% treasuries and the rest is corporate debt and MBS pass throughs (which can obviously encompass a lot). FAGIX is lower-quality debt across a ton of sectors. 

Would selling these holdings and purchasing another fund like FBAGX or FTABX be materially different enough to avoid a wash sale? Are there tools for comparing funds through the less of avoiding wash sales?"|0.72|3.0|0.0|3.0

Natural Gas storage in Europe ~ 93%. Enough for this winter. What is the long term solution? Coal fired generation plant decommissioning in Germany and other location being deferred (but for the sake of the environment must be done).

Coal companies (Arch, BTU) are seeing much improved EPS.

BTU’s third quarter EPS is indicated at ~$2 based on ~162 million shares on an (MSN) financial website.

Other websites show ~144 million shares in the (diluted) pool. So are EPS really ~13% higher?

Institutional and Insider share holdings are ~ 82% of float. (Based on the 144 million share float)

18% of 144 million is ~26 million shares in the ‘active’ float.

As of 09/15/22 ~15 million shares are ‘shorted’.  (~58% of ‘active’ float),

Average daily trade ~ 6 million shares. (23% of ‘active’ float traded every day?)

2 1/2 days to cover short interest-if shorts were the only ones buying.

Russian long term shut out of coal sales. Coal prices near record highs, situation not to change soon.

BTU earnings more than enough to retire all debt. Two ‘parts’ of the corporation retired $20.4 million in long term debt last month.

Who is keeping the BTU price range bound? What will the breakout price run to?

How much of next years EPS will the Institutional owners push to be paid out in dividends? Could be a significant sum if next years EPS are close to this years (guidance is ~US$8.50)

$8.50 EPS on a $25 stock? (And EPS could be significantly higher depending on which share count is correct.)

Once inflation gets entrenched in the services sector and in wages growth it's no longer about raw input material costs. People like Cathie Wood and Elon Musk have strong public voices but they seem to not know how exactly inflation is working. Once inflation spreads the only way of stopping it is causing what FED is currently doing. It's like a virus - if you don't kill it completely it'll recover and spread even more.

Sadly, I don't see a way to stop inflation without causing recession and widespread decrease in spending. Generally speaking, we need much better monetary discipline and tools to fight such events.

I have been DCAing around £2000 a month for a while now, i will continue doing that. Its basically all ETFs.

However,  I have around a further £8000 a month to invest and around £100k in cash.

The £8k PM will grow exponentially unless a train runs me over(recession!?)

I don't really know what to do with the £8000 PM and the Cash.

1. One option is to DCA the £100k evenly and plunge the £8000 a month on a DCA basis,
   1. Risks is that its a 10 year recovery and it makes me sad
   2. We are no where near the bottom and I should have dry powder to buy under priced stocks at a later date
   3. DCA removes all thinking and i could be laughing in 5-10 years.
2. Diversify with alternatives with that amount
   1. Farmland
   2. other stuff?
3. Put it in a savings account at around 5%
   1. Boring
   2. Mitigates loss to inflation despite still losing
4. Do not invest £8000PM and £100k, instead use it as dry powder when distressed assets (houses, commercial property, businesses) become available at lower prices

Obviously, we do not know if we are anywhere near the bottom or what the recovery will look like. Over 5,7 or 10 years? At the same time the money is unproductive and losing value.
